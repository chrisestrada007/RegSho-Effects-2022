# RegSho-Effects-2022
I dive into RegSHO and how it affects the stocks that get thresheld on it. Will they go VUPs? Will they get shorted into the ground?  I hope to find out.

Outline:
- Gather NYSE RegSHO data for 2022
- Compile data for 2022
- Gather data on price movements and timelines for price movements for 2022, 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months
-   + some of this will run into 2023, I'll need to update till July 2023
- Organize data for Tickers that run, decline, stay stagnent
- + Further break down effects into buckets based on percent changes (0-10%, 10-20%, etc.)(based on how data presents itself)
- Vizualize all
- + Focus on top gainers and top losers
